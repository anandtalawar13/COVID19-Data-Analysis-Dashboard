# COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard
An interactive data visualization dashboard built with **Python**, **Pandas**, **Plotly**, and **Dash** to analyze global COVID-19 trends.

## Project Overview
This dashboard empowers users to explore COVID-19 metrics across countries and timeframes. 
It features:
-  **Dynamic Line Charts** for daily and cumulative cases/deaths
-  **Vaccination Coverage Visualization** (% fully vaccinated)
-  **Comparative Bubble Chart** showing total cases vs deaths per million
-  **Interactive Controls**: country selector, date range, log scale toggle, case type switch
